[KingFisher](<https://github.com/coravacav/uofu-cs-discord-bot>) is an opportunistic comedian (RNG) that was written in [Rust](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>) (the greatest language) for this server (of nerds).
### Commands:
- `/help`: Display this help message.
- `/send_feedback`: Easily create a github issue for Kingfisher. Links to the issue creation page.
- `/list_classes`: List all classes you can join.
- `/join_class <course_id>`: Join a class. Gives the role / access to the channels.
- `/leave_class <course_id>`: Leave a class. Removes the role / access to the channels.
- `/my_classes`: List the classes you're in.
- `/catalog <course_id>`: Get information about a course. Either add a prefix like MATH2240 or CS will be assumed.
- `/search_catalog <search_string>`: Search the U of U course catalog for a course. Searches course code, title, and description.
- `/reactme`: Allow KingFisher automatic reactions to reply to your messages (including luck). Enables other features as well.
- `/ignoreme`: Disallow KingFisher automatic reactions to reply to your messages and disables other features.
- `/woof`: Add @Bark role
- `/muzzle`: Remove @Bark role
- `/yeet <user>`: Yeet a user with the Bot React role for 5 minutes. 6 yays or nays needed, yay for them, nay for you. You have 90 seconds. 
- `/timeout <duration>`: Timeout yourself for a parsable duration (e.g. 1d, 1h, 1m). Discord sets a limit at 4 weeks.
- `/aur <query> <amount>`: Queries the AUR. Can only display the top 20 entries at maximum.
- `/bank income`: Get some income (5 coins once per minute)
- `/bank balance`: What's my balance?

KingFisher also sometimes really likes to react to messages. That's why he replies sometimes (21% rate, unless you're pinging Stefan or typing "luck").

There is a way to force KingFisher to reply to a message. Add "KINGFISHER PLEASE" somewhere in the message to bypass the % chance. Add "HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME" to bypass the cooldown.

All of them think they’re the smartest person to roam the halls of campus. What’s more they try to one up each other to prove their clearly superior intellect, but nothing their saying makes sense and nothing actually gets done. It’s like these dudes are larping the scene in movies where they show a montage of people saying smart sounding nonsense, everyone understands it, and then two minutes later you have the finished product. Newsflash that shit isn’t real. This isn’t the goddamn Avengers.

For 85% of CS students, the stereotypes are true. It’s a bunch of smelly, antisocial dudes with huge egos whose only interests are video games, porn, and internet culture. I dare claim that I am a normal person, and as a normal person it bums me out. I look into classrooms sometimes and I see normal looking people and think that must be nice.

So, I was assigned a group (all male of course, this is CS we’re talking about) and met them, and for the love of god I have never met such insufferable, incel, dorks in my life.
One dude found it necessary to comment on nearly every woman’s appearance who walked by. Then basically all of them proceed to eye-fuck them from across the room the entire study session. I’m 1000% sure you’re all virgins. Your hot takes on women are under researched at best.

A course at a prestigious university should be a marathon. My favorites are the ones where attendance is required so you can see over time the lesser minds dropping out of the race in exhaustion. And finally at the end of the day the fittest survived and are rewarded with an honest grade in the class.
